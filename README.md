## General about this project and this Readme file 

I am creating this file beacause it's required to complete the course at the university,
I am gonna now play around functions in creating readme file in other files that i will add today perhaps.


As for the design I did it with course on YouTube guided by John Elder. 
The course was 4 hours long and was very simply and with well explained.


Project based on the CRUD model, create, read, update, delete and that's what the project is about,
We can add friends, update them, delete them or just read them.
We used bootstrap 4.1 and 5 to style a button or interface.
